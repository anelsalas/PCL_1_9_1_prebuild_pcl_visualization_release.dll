# PCL_1_9_1_prebuild_pcl_visualization_release.dll
pcl visualization dll withouth the vtk warnings.
Download this dll and replace it in your PCL bin folder, probably in C:\Program Files\PCL 1.9.1\bin if you are using 
the all in one installer from Tsukasa.

I made this availabe after this discussion here:
https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/issues/2619

To build the dll yourself you can follow Tsukasa Sugiura's blog here: http://unanancyowen.com/

Also, an official PCL release is coming with this hack: https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/pull/2912
